> 리소스 할당량 - `CPU: 4Core, Mem: 8GB, Disk: 5GB` 

- **CPU 할당량과 주기**: 컨테이너는 `cpu.cfs_quota_us`와 `cpu.cfs_period_us` 값으로 CPU 할당량을 설정하여 최대 4.8개의 코어를 사용할 수 있음
- **CPU 사용률 계산**: CPU 사용률은 컨테이너의 프로세스가 사용한 CPU 시간을 기준으로 측정되며, `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/cpuacct.usage` 파일에서 총 CPU 시간을 나노초 단위로 제공함
- **다중 코어 사용**: 컨테이너는 최대 4.8개의 CPU 코어를 사용할 수 있으며, 이는 단일 CPU 코어 용량의 480%를 사용할 수 있음
- **높은 병렬 처리**: 스트레스 테스트는 행렬 곱셈을 통해 높은 CPU 부하를 생성하여 여러 코어를 효율적으로 사용할 수 있음
